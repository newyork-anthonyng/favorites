Symptom: Unable to upload a file into AWS. An error was getting returned, saying that there was no 'PUT' method on the '/' route.

Cause: There was no information being returned from getting a signedRequest for S3. The uploadFile method was using an undefined URL to upload its file, using a 'PUT' method. Because there was no URL, it was hitting the '/' route as a default.

How found: There was a console.log error that there was no 'PUT' method on the '/' route. This console log was from the jquery.js file.

Fix: I needed to add all of the AWS keys onto Heroku.

Lessons: Add descriptive console.log messages when in development! This would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. Also when submitting to Heroku, remember what other things you have to do. There were times when I left the server as listening to a generic port (3000 or 8000), when I should've added 'process.env.PORT' in there as well.

Symptom: Frontend code was running on Desktop, but not on mobile.

Cause: Strict mode doesn't work on mobile.

How found: I was running front end code that had 'use strict' in it. The code didn't run on mobile.

Fix: I removed the 'use strict' from the front end code.

Lessons: Do not use strict mode in front end code.
